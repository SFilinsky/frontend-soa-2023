This is my learning project. There are two goals behind it:
- extend my frontend knowledge and extend my knowledge of things I didn't use much
- showcase my skills (including system design, coding, testing and automation)

Before implementing the project I'll design and document architecture in [./documentation](./documentation).

Here is list of contents in the most convenient reading order:

- [Requirements](./documentation/1-requirements.md)
- [Architecture](./documentation/2-architecture.md)
- [Tooling](./documentation/3-tooling.md)
- [Teammate Search application](./documentation/4-teammate-search.md)
