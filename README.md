This is my learning project. There are two goals behind it:
- extend my frontend knowledge and extend my knowledge of things I didn't use much
- showcase my skills (including system design, coding, testing and automation)

Before implementing the project I'll design and document architecture in [Design.md](DESIGN.md)
